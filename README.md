# Replication and Extension of SAC3

## Introduction
This project replicates and extends the SAC3 method for detecting hallucinations in large language models (LLMs). SAC3 improves traditional self-consistency checks by incorporating semantically equivalent question perturbations and cross-model response consistency. Semantic-aware cross-check consistency (SAC3) is a novel sampling-based hallucination detection method that expands on the principle of self-consistency checking and incorporates additional mechanisms to detect both question-level and model-level hallucinations by leveraging advances including semantically equivalent question perturbation and cross-model response consistency checking. 

## Project Overview

### Preparation
- **Literature Review**: Thoroughly reviewed the SAC3 paper and methodology.
- **Code Setup**: Adapted the authors' code for use in Google Colab.

### Replication Work
- **Initial Testing**: Evaluated datasets on GPT-3.5-turbo for binary classification and open-domain QA tasks.
- **Method Understanding**: Explored the effects of varying the number of self-responses and perturbed questions.
- **Model Testing**: Tested SAC3 on larger models (Guanaco-33b, Falcon-7b) and expanded datasets.

### Extended Work
- **Smaller Models**: Evaluated SAC3 on models with fewer than 10 billion parameters due to hardware constraints.
- **Customization**: Modified code and prompts for different model characteristics.
- **Bootstrap Testing**: Used bootstrap sampling to achieve more reliable results across multiple models.

## Key Findings
- **Robustness**: SAC3 effectively detects hallucinations across various models.
- **Performance Variability**: High variability indicates the need for further testing with larger datasets.

## Conclusion
SAC3 shows promise in enhancing hallucination detection in LLMs. Future work should focus on optimizing computational efficiency and expanding model and data testing.
